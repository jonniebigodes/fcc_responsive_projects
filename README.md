### Tech

This set of challenges uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [React] - Great Javascript library for Building user interfaces
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Gatsby] - A static site generator for React.



And of course the implementation of the challenges themselves are open source with a [git-repo-url]
 on GitHub.

### Installation from source

fcc-datavis requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Download and extract the [latest pre-built release](https://github.com/jonniebigodes/freecodecampdynamicwebapps/releases).

Before anything else you should install [Gatsby] globally, it will make your life easier.
To do that do the following:

```sh
npm install -g gatsby
```
Wait for it to finish and then install the dependencies and dev dependencies and start the server like the example bellow shows
```sh
$ cd folder to contain the app
$ npm install 
$ gatsby develop

Open url http://localhost:8000
```
